This can help to avoid unnecessary repetition of calculations and improve the overall performance of the program.\n```\n[/PYTHON]",

In practice, this test might cause a stack overflow for most systems due to the sheer number of recursive calls. It's included here as a theoretical check, but in reality, you should avoid such deep recursion.\n\nFinally, make sure to run the unit tests with Python and ensure that all tests pass for the `sequence` function to be confident about its correctness.

We need to ensure that it correctly handles these and does not result in a stack overflow for large `n`.\n3. **Large Values of `n`**: The function could potentially take a very long time to compute for large `n`, or even lead to a stack overflow if the recursion depth exceeds the limit.\n4. **Non-Integer Input**: The function should handle integer inputs only and should raise an error for non-integer input.\n5. **Negative Values and Zero**: The function does not explicitly handle these cases in the given code, but we should test how it behaves with them.\n6. **Consistency**: The function should produce consistent results across multiple runs for the same input.\n7. **Performance**: For large `n`, the function may perform inefficiently due to its recursive nature.

For example, let's add test cases to verify if our sequence function handles large inputs correctly:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom functools import lru_cache  # Added decorator to improve performance\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Memoization with LRU cache\ndef sequence(n):\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sequence(sequence(n-1)) + sequence(n-sequence(n-1))\n\nclass TestSequence(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_sequence_one(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(1), 1)\n\n    def test_sequence_two(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(2), 1)\n\n    def test_sequence_three(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(3), 2)\n\n    def test_sequence_four(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(4), 5)\n\n    def test_sequence_negative(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):  \n            sequence(-1)\n\n    # Test large inputs\n    def test_sequence_large_input(self):\n        self.assertGreaterEqual(sequence(1000), 10**300)  \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nAlso, please note that Python's recursion limit is relatively small (i.e., 1000). If you try to calculate `sequence(1500)` or greater, it will raise a RecursionError. This suggests that the recursive sequence function may not be suitable for large inputs due to stack overflow issues.",
      "cot": "Let's break down the function step by step and identify possible edge cases, scenarios, assertions, and logic involved.\n\n**Function Logic:**\n\nThe function `sequence(n)` uses a recursive approach to calculate the `n`th term of a sequence. The sequence is defined as:\n\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1\n\nFor `n > 2`, the function calls itself recursively with two arguments:\n\n- `n-1`: This corresponds to the `(n-1)`th term in the sequence.\n- `n-sequence(n-1)`: This is a bit tricky. We're essentially looking for the number of steps needed to go from the `(n-1)`th term to the `n`th term.\n\nThe function adds up these two values to get the final result.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n1.  **Negative Input:** What happens when `n` is negative? The function should raise an error or return a meaningful value.\n2.  **Zero Input:** What happens when `n` is zero? The function should probably raise an error or return a special value indicating that there's no sequence for zero elements.\n3.  **One and Two as Valid Inputs:** The function handles these cases correctly by returning 1 directly.\n\n**Scenarios:**\n\n-   **Small Values of n:** Test the function with small values of `n` (e.g., 3, 4, 5) to ensure it's working as expected.\n-   **Medium Values of n:** Test the function with medium values of `n` (e.g., 10, 20, 30).\n-   **Large Values of n:** Test the function with larger values of `n` to see how its performance scales.\n\n**Assertions:**\n\nThe function's return value should be compared against an expected result for each test case. We'll use assertions in our tests to validate these expectations.\n\nHere is the implementation of unit tests for this function using unittest:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestSequenceFunction(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_sequence_one(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(1), 1)\n\n    def test_sequence_two(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(2), 1) # corrected output - F(2)=1 (F(n)-n!)\n\n    def test_sequence_three(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(3), 2)\n\n    def test_sequence_four(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(4), 5)\n\n    def test_negative_input(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            sequence(-1)\n\n    def test_zero_input(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            sequence(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nHowever, this recursive approach has an exponential time complexity due to repeated computations. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming.\n\nHere is a revised implementation using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    memo = {1: 1, 2: 1} \n    def dp(i):\n        if i not in memo:\n            memo[i] = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - (i - 1))\n        return memo[i]\n    return dp(n)\n```\n\nAnd here are the updated unit tests for this revised function:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestSequenceFunction(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_sequence_one(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(1), 1)\n\n    def test_sequence_two(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(2), 1) \n\n    def test_sequence_three(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(3), 2)\n\n    def test_sequence_four(self):\n        self.assertEqual(sequence(4), 5)\n\n    def test_negative_input(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            sequence(-1)\n\n    def test_zero_input(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            sequence(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThis revised function uses memoization to store intermediate results, which reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear."
